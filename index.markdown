# Welcome

Hi, I'm Velu Kumaravel — a researcher working at the intersection of auditory neuroscience, EEG signal processing, and cognitive development. Currently, I’m a Scientific Assistant at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, as part of the Hearing4All cluster.

## Research Focus

- **Auditory Selective Attention**: Understanding and enhancing speech perception in noisy environments using neurofeedback and EEG.
- **EEG Signal Processing**: Developing robust pipelines and machine learning algorithms for artifact detection, channel selection, and feature extraction.
- **Neurodevelopment**: Investigating newborn and infant brain responses to speech stimuli using wearable EEG systems.
- **Deep Learning for Biosignals**: Applying and interpreting deep neural networks for EEG and other physiological signals like ECG and EDA.

## Featured Project

**SPINE: Speech Perception In Noise Enhancement via EEG-based Neurofeedback**

I'm currently exploring whether providing neurofeedback about attentional focus can enhance everyday listening in noisy settings. This is a 2-year funded project (including 10-month residential fellowship at Hanse-WissenshaftsKolleg, Delmenhorst) in collaboration with the Neuropsychology Lab, University of Oldenburg.
